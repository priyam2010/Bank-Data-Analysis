# Bank-Data-Analysis
 Introduction
 
 The goal of this project is to analyze a bank’s loan portfolio to gain insights into loan issuance trends, default patterns, and profitability across different customer segments.

The dashboard leverages historical data (2007–2014) to uncover relationships between loan characteristics (amount, grade, region, purpose) and financial outcomes (default rates, interest rates).

It supports forecasting, risk assessment, and profitability analysis using Excel visualizations.

 Problem Statement

The bank lacks actionable insights into:

How loan attributes influence default rates.

Region-wise and purpose-wise loan trends.

Accurate forecasting of interest rates to guide lending strategy.

Understanding the profitability of different customer categories (e.g., home ownership status).

Summary of Insights

Portfolio Overview:

Total loans: 69,000

Average loan amount: ₹14,111

Average interest rate: 13.69%

Default rate: 12.72%

Trend Analysis:

📉 Default rate declined sharply from ~16% in 2012 to ~9% in 2014.

📈 Loan amounts increased significantly from 2009 to 2013, peaking in 2013, followed by a drop in 2014.

Forecasting:

Forecast models predict a modest rise in average interest rates post-2013.

Confidence intervals indicate low volatility, useful for interest planning.

Demographic & Regional Distribution:

📍 Ulster and Northern Ireland received the highest loan amounts (~243.7M & 236.5M).

🏠 Most loans were issued to customers in low income categories (83.87%).

Loan Grade & Risk:

Default rate increases with lower loan grades:

Grade A: 4.56%

Grade G: 32.39%

Purpose-wise Loan Disbursal:

Loans for debt consolidation dominate, followed by credit cards and home improvement.

Car, vacation, and wedding loans received the least funding.

Profitability Index:

Home ownership status affects profitability:

“Other” and “None” categories have higher Loan Profitability Index (LPI) values.

“Mortgage”, “Own”, and “Rent” show slightly lower profitability.

Conclusion

A clear link exists between loan grade and risk — lower grades are riskier and should have stricter screening or higher interest rates.

Interest rates are stable but forecasted to increase, supporting the need for dynamic interest rate models.

Loan disbursement strategies are heavily skewed toward debt-related purposes, suggesting dependency on credit.

The dashboard offers a comprehensive view into loan health and serves as a strategic tool for improving lending decisions.

For enhanced decision-making, consider integrating this dashboard with Python analytics, Power BI, or machine learning models for predictive risk classification.
